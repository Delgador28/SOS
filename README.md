<!-- Project Title – S.O.S
•	Team Members –Erika Delgado, Marilyn Pagan, Adam Sheets
•	Project Description:
S.O.S is a mobile application that will allow the user to discreetly send out to their network of ‘allies’ a message if they find themselves in a precarious situation, such as a date gone wrong, stranded at a party, or just general discomfort in a social situation. A user will sign up via the application and provide a minimum of two contacts that will receive a message advising them of the situation at hand, whether uncomfortable or pleasant. 
•	The "Who, What, Why" - Who needs your app, what your app does, and why it is valuable.
Who is this product focusing on?
- Initially this application will be aim at females between the age of 16-30, as studies have shown they are the most vulnerable in social settings.

What this product does:
-This product will provide an easy and discreet communication option, when a phone call or text is not an option. 
-Users will complete a profile where they chose a minimum of 2 contacts who will receive the automated message, indicating one of the following choices: I am ok – no need to worry, Please call me and give me any excuse to get out of here, or This is my location please call for help. 
- Users information will be stored in mysql to allow for easy access when it is called upon. 

Why is this product needed?
-	This product is needed because studies have shown that females are most likely to be targets of unwanted attention, harassment and assault. 
-	Women often times feel the need to have an excuse to leave a situation where if otherwise it might provoke a would be assailant.
